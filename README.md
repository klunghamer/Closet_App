# Closet_App

This application allows users to login, add photos, and manage their personal closets while giving them the capability to navigate through other usersâ€™ closets.

### Planning

Wireframes were constructed to set up the original structure of the site and plan where information could be found for the user: [wireframes.pdf](wireframes.pdf).

[User stories](https://trello.com/b/Z6VBLVXy/custom-closets-user-stories) are hosted on trello, which helped organize how the user would interact with the application, and what would happen after each interaction.
